* We’ve also added the **Look at** condition, enabling more precise control over interactions.

* We’ve added the ability to import 3D files directly from the dashboard — now you can quickly upload a file and generate a project link without even opening Studio.\
  More details here: [https://help.vectary.com/documentation/getting-started/dashboard#upload-3d-file](https://help.vectary.com/documentation/getting-started/dashboard#upload-3d-file)<br>

### June 2



* Fixed bug where changes to `Duration` in one interaction affected another
* Fixed bug where switching between `Stroke` and `Fill` tabs in [Highlight](../documentation/3d-configurator/interactions/actions/highlight.md) action reset highlight settings

#### USDZ import

We adjusted `USDZ` import so that files exported from Vectary now retain the **correct scale**. Previously, such files were imported at a **very small size**. Unfortunately, due to format limitations, this change may cause USDZ files from other software to appear oversized in Vectary. We hope to improve this behavior in the future.
