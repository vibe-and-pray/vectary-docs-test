#### USDZ

It's now possible to export `USDZ` files in **binary** format. The binary version is significantly smaller in file size compared to ASCII.\

#### Previously uploaded textures

Fixes to various bugs related to the uploaded textures list also made it possible to use this list in the **Swatches** ([Variants](../documentation/3d-configurator/floating-ui/variants-ui.md) and [Materials](../documentation/3d-configurator/floating-ui/materials-ui.md) elements of the [Floating UI](../documentation/3d-configurator/floating-ui/)).\

#### WebXR/AR improvements

1. In this update, the behavior and configuration of icons for [WebXR](../documentation/project-settings/webxr-beta.md) and [AR](../documentation/project-settings/augmented-reality-webar.md#settings) have been improved. Projects will now display only one icon, even when both WebXR and AR are enabled. For example, if the device does not support WebXR, the AR icon will be shown (assuming both have been added to the project).
2. Another improvement is that entry into AR and WebXR experiences can now be triggered not only through the icon, but also through any object or [UI](../documentation/3d-configurator/floating-ui/) element, thanks to the addition of a new [trigger](../documentation/3d-configurator/interactions/triggers.md), [conditions](../documentation/3d-configurator/interactions/conditions.md), and [actions](../documentation/3d-configurator/interactions/actions/).
