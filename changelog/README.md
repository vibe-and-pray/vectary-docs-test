## Discord

Release notes are also published on the official [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/kbfe4SxzMg).

\
We also encourage you to post bug reports on our Discord server (in the #bug-reports channel). It makes it easier to discuss issues in a dedicated thread and allows us to notify you directly once they’re resolved. Public threads also help us better gauge how widespread an issue is and may influence how we prioritize fixes.

Thanks so much for helping us make Vectary even better!
