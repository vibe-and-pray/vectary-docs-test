# Cap open boundaries

The **Cap Open Boundaries** tool fills open holes in geometry by generating new faces along the boundary edges, ensuring a closed mesh.



#### How it works

* Select an open boundary (hotkey `O`)&#x20;
* Press **`Ctrl+O`** to activate the tool
* A new face is automatically created, capping the selected boundary

#### Use Cases

* Closing gaps in a mesh to prepare it for further modeling.
* Ensuring a watertight mesh.
* Simplifying manual face creation by automatically generating a cap over open boundaries.
