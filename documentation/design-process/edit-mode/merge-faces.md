# Merge faces

The **Merge Faces** tool combines multiple adjacent faces into a single face, reducing geometry complexity while maintaining the overall shape of the model.

#### How it works

* Select two or more connected faces.
* Activate the tool to merge them into a single face, removing unnecessary edges.

#### Use Cases

* Simplifying geometry for optimization and performance improvements.
* Cleaning up topology by reducing unnecessary subdivisions.
* Preparing models for efficient UV mapping and texturing.
