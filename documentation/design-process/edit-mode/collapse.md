# Collapse

The **Collapse** tool reduces geometry by merging selected vertices, edges, or faces into a single point. It automatically collapses the selection to its geometric center, simplifying topology while preserving overall mesh structure.

Select the vertices, edges, or faces to be collapsed, then press **`X`** to activate the tool.
