# Slide



The **Slide** tool allows shifting edges along their connected geometry while maintaining surface integrity. It is useful for refining topology and adjusting edge flow.

Can only be applied to edges
{% endhint %}



#### How it works

* Select one or multiple edges
* Press **N** to activate the tool
* Once activated, a blue handle appears:
  * Dragging the handle moves the edge along its surface.
  * Holding **Shift** while dragging the handle creates a duplicate of the edge and moves it along the surface.
  * Clicking on the handle opens a context menu with additional settings.

#### Context menu options

* **Offset** – controls the displacement distance of the edge from its original position
* **Copies** – duplicates the selected edge and slides the copies along the surface
