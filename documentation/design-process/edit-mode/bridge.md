# Bridge



The **Bridge** tool creates new geometry to seamlessly connect selected vertices, edges, or faces. It is useful for filling gaps, merging separate mesh parts, and maintaining smooth topology in complex models.



#### How it works

1. Select the vertices, edges, or faces that need to be connected before activating the tool.
2. Press **`V`** to activate the Bridge tool.
3. After applying, new geometry is generated, and a context menu appears with additional parameters for fine-tuning the connection.



#### Context Menu Options

* **Segments** – Specifies the number of subdivisions along the bridge for a smoother transition.
* **Strength** – Controls the intensity of the bridge deformation.
* **Twist** – Rotates the bridge connection to improve topology alignment.
* **Perpendicular** – Adjusts the direction of the bridge to maintain a perpendicular angle.
* **Smooth** – Softens the transition by adjusting curvature and blending the connection.
* **Connect Closest** – Automatically links the nearest corresponding elements between the selected geometry.
* **Connect in Order** – Establishes connections based on the selection order, ensuring a controlled bridge formation.
