# Draw

The Draw tool enables the creation of geometry by sketching directly in the scene. It supports two modes: **Draw Lines**, for precise straight-line segments, and **Hand Draw**, for freehand shapes with post-processing options. All drawing takes place on a single plane to maintain consistent alignment.

#### **Draw Lines**

* Creates straight-line drawings by placing points, automatically connecting them with straight segments.
* To generate a filled shape, the line must be closed. Enabling snapping to `End` ensures precise alignment of endpoints, making closure more accurate and efficient. \

#### **Hand Draw**

Enables freehand drawing with more organic shapes.

* After drawing, a menu appears with options to refine the line:
  * Close the line
  * Smooth the curve
  * Remove sharp angles
  * Increase line detail
* To fill the shape with geometry, select the line and press **`Ctrl+O`  (**[cap-open-boundaries.md](cap-open-boundaries.md "mention")`)`
