# Extrude



The **Extrude** tool generates additional geometry by extending selected vertices, edges, or faces along a specific direction. The new geometry remains connected to the original mesh, preserving its topology.

#### How it works

* Select a vertex, edge, or face before activating the tool
* Press **`E`** to activate the extrude function, then drag the blue arrow forward or backward to control the extrusion depth
* Alternatively, hold **`Ctrl`** and drag the Gizmo for a quick extrusion without activating the tool
