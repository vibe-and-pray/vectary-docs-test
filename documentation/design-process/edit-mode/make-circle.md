# Make circle

The **Make Circle** tool reshapes a selected set of vertices, edges, or faces into a circular formation while maintaining their relative position within the mesh. It is particularly useful for creating round openings, refining cylindrical shapes, or aligning geometry with circular precision.



#### How it works

* Select the vertices, edges, or faces to be transformed into a circular shape.
* Activate the tool.
* After activation, a blue handle appears. Dragging this handle adjusts the radius of the resulting shape. Clicking on the handle opens a context menu with additional options for fine-tuning.
