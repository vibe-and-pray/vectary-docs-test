# Cut



The **Cut** tool allows slicing geometry by adding new edges. It supports two cutting methods: **Single Cut** and **Multiple Cut**.



#### Single Cut

* Press **`C`** to activate.
* Define the cut by setting two points to determine the cutting vector.
* After defining the cut, a context menu appears with additional options:
  * **Split** – Separates the geometry along the cut.
  * **Cap** – Closes open edges resulting from the cut.
  * **Gap** – Creates a gap between the newly created edges.

#### Multiple Cut

* Double-press **`C`** to activate.
* After the first cut, continue performing additional cuts until pressing **`Esc`** to exit.
* This method does not include additional settings; it simply generates multiple new edges.

#### Additional information

* If one or more faces are selected before using **Cut**, new edges will be created only within the selected faces, ensuring localized modifications.
