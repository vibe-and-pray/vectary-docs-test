# Primitives

In Edit mode, basic geometric primitives can be generated directly within an existing object. This allows for seamless integration of new geometry into the current mesh structure without creating separate objects. \
Primitives provide a foundation for modeling, allowing for further modifications using edit mode tools.



Primitives are created in a multi-step process:

1. First, the shape of the primitive is defined using the cursor.
2. After placement, a context menu appears, allowing adjustments to its form, dimensions, and segment count.

* **Box** – Creates a six-sided cube that can be modified by adjusting its dimensions.
* **Sphere** – Generates a smooth, rounded shape with adjustable segment density.
* **Cone** – Creates a tapered shape with a circular base, customizable in height and segments.
* **Cylinder** – Produces a uniform cylindrical form with a defined number of sides.
* **Tube** – Generates a hollow cylinder with inner and outer radius controls.
* **Torus** – Creates a ring-shaped object with adjustable inner and outer radius, as well as segment density.
* **Polyhedron** – Generates a multi-faced geometric shape with customizable parameters for different polyhedral structures.
