# Soft Shadows

The **Soft Shadows** effect enhances shadow realism by creating smoother, more natural-looking shadow edges, reducing harsh transitions between light and shadow.



{% hint style="danger" %}
This effect improves visual quality but has a **high** impact on performance. It is recommended to enable it selectively for scenes that require realistic shadow transitions.
