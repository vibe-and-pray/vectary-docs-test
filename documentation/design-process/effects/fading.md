# Fading

The **Fading** effect simulates atmospheric fog, softening distant objects and enhancing depth perception in the scene.&#x20;



#### Settings:

* **Start** – defines where the fog effect begins. A pipette tool allows selecting an object to automatically set the fog start distance based on its position.
* **Intensity** – adjusts the strength of the fog effect, controlling how much it obscures objects in the distance.
