# Adjustments

The **Adjustments** effect provides fine-tuned control over the scene's color and brightness properties, refining the overall color balance and lighting behavior to achieve a more polished and professional appearance.

#### Settings:



* **Saturation** – adjusts the intensity of colors, making them more vivid or muted
* **Contrast** – controls the difference between light and dark areas, affecting overall scene depth
* **Exposure** – alters the brightness of the entire scene, simulating camera exposure effects
* **Tonemapping** – applies predefined color grading curves to balance highlights and shadows:
  * **None** – no tonemapping applied
  * **Filmic** – produces a cinematic look with balanced contrast.
  * **Reinhard** – compresses high dynamic range values for more natural exposure.
  * **ACES** – uses industry-standard color grading for physically accurate color reproduction.
  * **Cineon** – mimics film-like contrast and tonal response.
