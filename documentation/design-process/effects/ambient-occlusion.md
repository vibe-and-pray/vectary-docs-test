# Ambient Occlusion

The **Ambient Occlusion** effect enhances depth and realism by simulating soft contact shadows in areas where surfaces are close to each other, such as corners, creases, and intersections.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This effect has a **medium** impact on performance. It is recommended to enable it only when necessary or when the scene is highly optimized.
{% endhint %}

#### Settings:

* **Intensity** – controls the strength of the shadow effect. Higher values create darker and more pronounced ambient shadows.
* **Radius** – determines how far the effect extends from the contact areas. A higher radius results in broader, softer shadows, while a lower radius keeps shadows tighter and more defined.

For a more realistic result and better performance, we recommend baking AO.. Learn more here: [ambient-occlusion-texture.md](../materials-and-textures/baked-textures/ambient-occlusion-texture.md "mention")
