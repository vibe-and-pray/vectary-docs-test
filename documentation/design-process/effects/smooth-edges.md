# Smooth edges

The **Smooth Edges** effect enhances visual clarity by reducing pixelation and jagged edges on objects. It utilizes **MSAA (Multisample Anti-Aliasing)** to create smoother, more refined visuals, improving overall scene quality.

{% hint style="danger" %}
This effect has a **high** impact on performance. It is recommended to enable it only when necessary or when the scene is highly optimized.
{% endhint %}



#### Settings:

\
**MSAA Samples** – Determines the level of anti-aliasing applied to object edges. Higher values result in smoother edges but increase performance cost.

* **2x MSAA** – low smoothing, minimal performance impact
* **4x MSAA** – balanced quality and performance
* **8x MSAA** – maximum smoothing, higher performance cost
