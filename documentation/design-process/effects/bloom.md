# Bloom

The **Bloom** effect enhances bright areas by creating a glowing halo around them, simulating realistic light scattering and adding depth to the scene.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This effect has a **medium** impact on performance. It is recommended to enable it only when necessary or when the scene is highly optimized.
{% endhint %}

#### Settings:

* **Intensity** – controls the strength of the glow effect. Higher values produce a more pronounced bloom.
* **Threshold** – determines the brightness level at which the bloom effect is applied. Lower values make more areas glow, while higher values limit the effect to the brightest spots.
* **Size** – adjusts the spread of the glow, affecting how far the bloom extends from the light source.

{% hint style="success" %}
Each of these values can be set manually above 100% by entering a custom number
