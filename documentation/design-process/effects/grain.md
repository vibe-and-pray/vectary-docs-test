# Grain

The **Grain** effect adds a subtle film-like noise texture to the scene, enhancing realism, providing a cinematic aesthetic, and creating a more organic visual style by adding texture and reducing banding.

#### Settings:

* **Intensity** – controls the strength of the grain effect. Higher values result in a more pronounced grain, while lower values keep the effect subtle.
* **Mode**:
  * **Multiplicative** – applies grain based on the scene’s brightness, making darker areas more affected.
  * **Additive** – applies grain uniformly across the entire scene, regardless of brightness levels.
