# Animated materials

Vectary Studio supports importing animated files such as **Lottie**, **GIF**, or **MP4** for versatile uses within your scenes. These animations can function as **textures**, **decals**, **UI elements**, or **interactive hotspots**.



### Importing animated files as textures



* Open a material property that supports texture import
* Select the **Animation** option
* Upload your animated file (Lottie, GIF, or MP4)

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (266).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

#### **Video with audio**

When a video file containing an audio track is uploaded, a slider appears in the texture settings to control the audio volume.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (516).png>)
{% endhint %}





### Importing animated files as separate objects



* Drag an animated file directly onto the canvas
* This imports a file as a textured plane
* The textured plane can then be positioned, resized, or applied onto any 3D object as a decal or sticker ([decals.md](decals.md "mention"))
