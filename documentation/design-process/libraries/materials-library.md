# Materials library



The **Material Library** provides a collection of pre-made materials organized into categories such as wood, metal, cement, glass, fabric, leather, plastic, and more. Custom materials can also be added to this library for reuse across different projects.



To open the material library, select an object and click the **book icon** next to the material name.

It is recommended to create a dedicated **folder** in the workspace for storing material projects to keep them separate from regular projects for better organization and quick access
