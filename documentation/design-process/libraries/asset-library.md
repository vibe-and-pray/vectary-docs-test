# Asset library

The **Asset Library** (Design System) allows importing existing projects into the current scene. It provides a structured way to manage and reuse 2D/3D assets across different projects.



## **Importing an existing project**



To import an existing project into the current scene:

1. open the **Workspace** tab from the left panel
2. select the desired **workspace** from the dropdown menu
3. browse through the folder structure containing your projects
4. drag and drop the project thumbnail into the scene to import it, or click it to place it at the center of the scene

{% hint style="info" %}
To import a project with all its settings, perform the same action while holding **`Alt`**&#x20;
{% endhint %}





## **Saving 3D objects as project**

Any object or group of objects in the current project can be saved as a project, turning them into reusable assets.

1. Select the objects
2. Right-click and choose **Create project from selection** in the context menu

{% hint style="info" %}
All animations and interactions linked to the selected objects will be preserved
{% endhint %}





## **Importing projects with animations and interactions**

When importing a project, all **animations and interactions** associated with it will be included.

{% hint style="success" %}
This allows for the creation of template projects containing only **keyframes** or **interaction settings**, reducing the need for repetitive setup
{% endhint %}





## **Floating UI and Hotspots as assets**

If a project contains **Floating UIs** and **Hotspots**, they will also be imported.

{% hint style="success" %}
This enables the creation and storage of various 2D elements for reuse as **2D assets**
{% endhint %}



## **Organizing the Asset library**

To keep the **Asset library** organized and easy to navigate, it is recommended to:

* Create folders within the **Workspace** to separate different types of assets
* Maintain clear categorization to ensure quick access and efficient project management
