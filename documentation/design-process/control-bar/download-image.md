# Download image

The image download option instantly saves a high-resolution PNG file. The image is rendered using the same real-time renderer, ensuring it matches what is seen in Studio. Learn more about the renderer here: [rendering.md](../../getting-started/rendering.md "mention")

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (246).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To adjust the aspect ratio of the downloaded image, add a camera, enable the [#custom-aspect-ratio](../camera.md#custom-aspect-ratio "mention") setting, and set the desired ratio. Then, while viewing through the camera, download the image.



For a more convenient image generation workflow, we recommend using the Figma plugin. Learn more here: [vectary-plugin-for-figma.md](../../other/vectary-plugin-for-figma.md "mention")
