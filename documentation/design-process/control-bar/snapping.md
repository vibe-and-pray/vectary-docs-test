# Snapping



## Overview



Snapping enhances precision by automatically aligning objects and elements to specific points, grids, or surfaces. This ensures accurate placement, alignment, and transformation adjustments in both Design and Edit modes, making object manipulation more efficient and consistent.



Snapping can be toggled on and off using the **`S`** hotkey.

In the **Control bar**, the magnet icon represents the snapping toggle:

* **Enabled** – active snapping options will function
* **Disabled** – no snapping will be applied

Specific snapping types can be individually activated or deactivated by clicking on their name. When active, they appear in **purple**.
