# Fit View



The **Fit View** function enhances scene navigation by adjusting the camera to focus on a selected object or all objects in the scene, making it easier to inspect and manipulate objects from an optimal perspective.

#### How it works:

* **Focusing on an object**: select an object and press **`A`**, or click the **Fit View** icon. The camera will frame the selected object and rotate around it.
* **Fitting all objects**: click on an empty area of the canvas and press **`A`**. The camera will adjust to fit all visible objects in the scene, centering the view at the midpoint between them.
