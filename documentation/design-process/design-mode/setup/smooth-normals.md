# Smooth normals



Controls how object normals are smoothed, adjusting the transition between sharp and soft shading across surfaces. The angle setting, which defaults to 40 degrees, controls the transition between sharp and smooth shading. A value of 0 preserves all hard edges, while increasing the value progressively softens them, blending the shading across adjacent faces.
