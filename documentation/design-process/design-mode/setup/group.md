# Group



* **Group** — `Ctrl+G`

Organizes multiple objects into a single group, allowing for easier management and manipulation.

* **Ungroup** — `Ctrl+Shift+G`

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deleting a group removes both the group and its contents. To dissolve a group without deleting its contents, use the **Ungroup** function `Ctrl+Shift+G`, which removes the grouping while keeping all objects intact.

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
This function also applies to modifiers, deformers, Variants, and other tools that operate based on the Group principle.
{% endhint %}



Group also has a setting that allows switching between a standard group and [empty.md](empty.md "mention")
