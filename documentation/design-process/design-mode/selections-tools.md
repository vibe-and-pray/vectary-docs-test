Selection tools allow precise control over object selection in the scene. Different methods provide flexibility depending on the workflow and selection requirements.

## Selection tools



These tools streamline the selection process, making it easier to manage complex scenes and make precise edits.



<table><thead><tr><th width="115">Type</th><th width="100">Hotkey</th><th width="495">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Select</td><td><strong><code>Esc</code></strong></td><td>The default selection tool is active when no other tool is in use. It allows selecting objects individually with a single click.</td></tr><tr><td>Marquee</td><td><strong><code>M</code></strong></td><td>Click and drag to create a rectangular selection area, selecting all objects within it.</td></tr><tr><td>Lasso</td><td><strong><code>L</code></strong></td><td>Draw a freeform selection around objects to include them within the selection.</td></tr><tr><td>Paint select</td><td><strong><code>P</code></strong></td><td>Click and drag to paint over objects, gradually adding them to the selection.</td></tr><tr><td>Select all</td><td><strong><code>Ctrl+A</code></strong></td><td>Instantly selects all visible and unlocked objects in the scene.</td></tr><tr><td>Invert selection</td><td></td><td>Reverses the current selection, deselecting selected objects and selecting unselected ones.</td></tr></tbody></table>



{% hint style="info" %}
To select multiple objects, hold `Shift` when selecting objects on the canvas or hold `Ctrl`/`Cmd` when selecting from the left panel. \
In the left panel, objects can also be selected in a range by holding `Shift`.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Locked objects cannot be selected on the canvas but can be selected from the left panel.
{% endhint %}



#### Deep selection

When an object is inside a group or affected by a modifier, it can be selected directly by holding Ctrl/Cmd while clicking on it. This bypasses the group or modifier, allowing for precise selection.





## Selection manager



Selections can be saved and then used in various project settings.&#x20;
