# Decals



## Overview



Vectary Studio simplifies applying designs onto 3D objects through decals. Decals allow quick and intuitive application of images, animations, or videos directly onto the surface of any geometry.

Supported formats: **JPG**, **PNG**, **WebP**, **SVG**, **Lottie**, **GIF**, **MP4**&#x20;

## How it works



{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Import your file**

Just dragging it onto the canvas
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Apply decal**

Grab the pivot point of the imported plane and move it towards the 3D object. It will automatically adapt to the geometry's surface.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Adjusting**

Once placed, decals can be resized or rotated using the Gizmo
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Editing decals



* A decal is a regular 3D object with the same properties, including full control over materials, textures, and other 3D object settings.
* **Offset** — available after a decal is attached to an object; shifts the decal away from the surface to prevent flickering caused by overlapping geometry.\

{% hint style="info" %}
Selecting the same texture in the [Emission](materials-and-textures/basic-materials/emission.md) property as in [Color](materials-and-textures/basic-materials/color.md) makes the decal appear bright and unaffected by scene lighting.
{% endhint %}



## Figma integration



* Decals can also be imported directly from Figma — [figma-frames-import.md](../importing/figma-frames-import.md "mention")
* Any changes made in Figma can be updated in Vectary Studio with just one click
