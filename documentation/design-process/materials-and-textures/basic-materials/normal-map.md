# Normal map

Normal maps enhance the visual quality of materials by adding intricate surface details without increasing polygon count. They simulate bumps, scratches, or fabric textures without modifying the actual geometry. This effect relies on imported textures and is achieved by manipulating how light interacts with the surface, enhancing realism and depth.

**Invert** option flips the texture’s details, which can help correct shading issues or adjust the perceived depth of the surface.
