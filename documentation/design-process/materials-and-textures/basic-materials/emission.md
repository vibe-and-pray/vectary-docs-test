# Emission

Makes a material emit light, allowing it to glow regardless of the scene’s lighting. The effect becomes more pronounced in darker environments.

A custom glow color can be selected to achieve different lighting effects.

{% hint style="success" %}
The intensity value can be set higher than `100` for stronger illumination
{% endhint %}

Emission textures are often used to make textured objects appear brighter and less dependent on scene lighting. Typically, the same texture used for **Color** is applied to **Emission** to enhance brightness and visibility.

{% hint style="info" %}
To create a halo or neon-like effect, enable the [bloom.md](../../effects/bloom.md "mention") effect
{% endhint %}
