# Roughness

Controls how glossy or rough a surface appears. A value of 0 creates a perfectly smooth surface with high specular reflection, but for a mirror-like effect, the material also needs full metalness. While higher values result in a diffuse, matte finish. A roughness texture can be used to vary the effect across the surface, adding realism.
