# Ambient occlusion (texture)

Ambient Occlusion is an effect that simulates soft shadows and shading by calculating how geometry blocks ambient light, adding depth and realism to 3D models.

An **Ambient Occlusion** **(AO)** **texture** is pre-rendered and stored as an image, enhancing realism without negatively impacting performance during real-time rendering. This texture can be generated directly within Vectary Studio or imported from external software



{% hint style="info" %}
The AO texture generation does not depend on scene lighting conditions. It captures geometry-based shading purely from the distances and angles between surfaces. Therefore, AO textures remain consistent and effective regardless of lighting changes within the scene.
{% endhint %}



Recommended uses:

* Static scenes
* High-detail objects requiring realistic shading
* Scenes aiming for optimized rendering performance
