# Lightmap

A Lightmap is a pre-rendered texture that stores lighting information, including environmental lighting, local light sources, and material properties of each object within a scene. Using a Lightmap texture significantly enhances the realism of lighting without compromising real-time performance.



Key features of lightmap:

* Captures detailed information about the environmental lighting, local light sources, and material attributes of objects
* Improves rendering efficiency by reducing the need for real-time lighting calculations
* Provides highly realistic lighting and shadow effects for static scenes
