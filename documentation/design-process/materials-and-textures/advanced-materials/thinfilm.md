# Thinfilm

Replicates the interference effect seen in thin layers of transparent material, such as soap bubbles or oil on water. The intensity of the effect can be adjusted from 0 to 100%. It creates iridescent color shifts depending on the viewing angle. Thinfilm is controlled through a gradient, allowing precise customization of color shifts.&#x20;

Additional colors can be added beyond the three default ones, enabling more complex iridescent effects.
