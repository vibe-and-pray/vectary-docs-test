# Refraction

Controls how light bends when passing through a transparent material, simulating effects like glass, water, or gemstones.&#x20;

This property includes a value range from 0 to 100, which controls the strength of the refraction effect. A value of 0 results in no refraction, while 100 produces the strongest bending of light. \
\
**Index of Refraction (IOR)** determines how much light changes direction when passing through the material. Common IOR values include 1.0 for air, 1.33 for water, 1.52 for standard glass, and higher values for denser materials like diamonds (2.42).

**Thickness and Absorption** parameters refine how light interacts within the material. **Thickness** influences the perceived density, while **Absorption** determines how much light is lost as it passes through. A selectable color defines the absorption effect, adding depth and realism.



{% hint style="info" %}
The appearance of refractive materials is highly dependent on lighting conditions, as reflections, distortions, and transparency change based on the surrounding environment.&#x20;

Enabling [double-sided-material.md](double-sided-material.md "mention") can significantly improve the object's appearance by enhancing how light interacts with both front and back surfaces of the material.
