# Subsurface

Simulates light scattering beneath the surface of an object, creating a soft, translucent effect. This property is crucial for materials like skin, leaves, wax, and marble, where light penetrates, scatters, and exits at different points, producing a natural look. \
\
A **color** can be selected to define the scattering effect. Additionally, a **radius** parameter controls the depth of light penetration, adjusting the softness and intensity of the effect for greater realism.
