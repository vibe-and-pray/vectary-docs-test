# Clearcoat

Adds an extra transparent layer on top of a material, simulating varnishes, car paints, or protective coatings.&#x20;

The **intensity** of the effect ranges from 0 to 100%.&#x20;

A **color** can be assigned to tint the clearcoat layer, influencing how it blends with the base material and altering its final appearance.&#x20;

This layer has its own **roughness** settings, with roughness adjustable from 0 to 100%, allowing for enhanced surface detail and precise control over the finish.

Note that the visibility and impact of the Clearcoat effects are highly dependent on the scene lighting. Different lighting conditions can significantly alter the visual perception of the coating, so it's recommended to fine-tune the lighting for optimal results.
