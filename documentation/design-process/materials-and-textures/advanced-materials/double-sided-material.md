# Double sided material

The **Double-Sided Material** option enables rendering of both the front and back faces of a surface, ensuring the material is visible from all angles. This is particularly useful for thin objects like paper, leaves, or fabric, where both sides need to be rendered without requiring additional geometry.

Enabling this feature ensures correct shading and lighting behavior, improving realism in scenes where single-sided rendering would cause visibility issues.

It can negatively impact performance as it doubles the number of rendered faces. It is recommended to use this option only when necessary.
