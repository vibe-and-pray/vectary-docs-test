# Advanced materials

Advanced material properties provide greater flexibility in creating realistic surfaces such as high-performance polymers, tempered glass, frosted glass, coated metals, and multilayered composites. These properties allow for precise customization, making it possible to achieve complex materials with layered and dynamic visual effects.



<table><thead><tr><th width="158.27734375">Property</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a data-mention href="subsurface.md">subsurface.md</a></td><td>Simulates light scattering beneath the surface of an object, creating a soft, translucent effect.</td></tr><tr><td><a data-mention href="refraction.md">refraction.md</a></td><td>Controls how light bends when passing through a transparent material, simulating effects like glass, water, or gemstones. </td></tr><tr><td><a data-mention href="clearcoat.md">clearcoat.md</a></td><td>Adds an extra transparent layer on top of a material, simulating varnishes, car paints, or protective coatings. </td></tr><tr><td><a data-mention href="thinfilm.md">thinfilm.md</a></td><td>Replicates the interference effect seen in thin layers of transparent material, such as soap bubbles or oil on water. </td></tr><tr><td><a data-mention href="reflectivity.md">reflectivity.md</a></td><td>Defines how much light is reflected from the surface of a material, influencing its shininess and realism.</td></tr><tr><td><a data-mention href="double-sided-material.md">double-sided-material.md</a></td><td>Enables rendering of both the front and back faces of a surface, ensuring the material is visible from all angles.</td></tr></tbody></table>
