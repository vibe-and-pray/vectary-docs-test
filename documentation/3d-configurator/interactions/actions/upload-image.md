# Upload image

The **Upload Image** action allows end users to upload an image into the 3D configurator.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (232).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



**Settings**



* **Material** — Choose the material to which the uploaded image will be applied. **Note:** The image is assigned to a material, not to an object.
*   **Property Selection** — Specify which material properties the uploaded image will affect. Available options include:

    * [color.md](../../../design-process/materials-and-textures/basic-materials/color.md "mention")
    * [opacity.md](../../../design-process/materials-and-textures/basic-materials/opacity.md "mention")
    * [emission.md](../../../design-process/materials-and-textures/basic-materials/emission.md "mention")

    All other material properties remain unchanged, meaning the uploaded image will only be applied to the selected properties.
