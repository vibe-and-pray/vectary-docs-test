# 3D to image (GenAI)



### Overview



AI Image Generation provides a way to create new images based on a combination of a 3D canvas, optional image references, and a text prompt. This feature can be used to produce enhanced renders, explore visual concepts, or generate stylistic variations derived from a 3D project.

AI Image Generation uses multiple inputs:<br>

* **3D canvas content** – a real-time reference of the current scene.
* **Optional reference images** – up to two additional images for style, material, or concept guidance.
* **Text prompt** – a description that directs the generation process.



A generated output can represent an improved render of a 3D scene or a completely new interpretation based on the provided references and prompt.



### Image References



The **Image References** section contains three available slots.

* **Canvas slot** - the first slot, **Canvas**, displays the 3D canvas content in real time. Any scene updates - such as object changes or camera adjustments - are immediately reflected in this slot.\
  The Canvas slot can be disabled if the 3D canvas should not be used as a reference.<br>
* **Optional image slots** - the second and third slots are optional and accept uploaded images. These slots are useful for providing additional visual context, such as specifying a visual style, defining material qualities, or referencing design elements that should appear in the generated output.





### Aspect Ratio settings



The generation settings include an option to choose an aspect ratio for the final output. An aspect ratio determines the shape of a generated image, allowing alignment with various formats such as square, widescreen, or social‑media‑optimized layouts.

### History



All generated outputs are automatically saved in the **History** tab, allowing convenient review and comparison of previous results.

### Downloading



After a generation is completed, the resulting output appears on the canvas. A download button below the canvas provides a way to save the generated result as an image file on a computer.
