# Image to 3D model



Vectary allows the generation of textured 3D objects using a wide range of popular AI models. The following models are currently available:



* **Hunyuan 3**
* **Seed 3D**
* **Trellis 2**
* **Meshy 6**
* **Rodin 2**
* **OmniPart**
* **Hunyuan 2.1**

\
These AI models differ in output quality, polygon count, and generation time.

The process does not require any configuration — simply drag an image onto the canvas and wait some time for the result:

The video uses a **Hunyuan 3** AI model, with the generation process sped up.

An image for generation can be imported not only by drag and drop, but also using this icon in the toolbar:

## What can be done after generation



After generation, a model can be further refined and used in multiple ways:



* Polygon count can be reduced using the [**Simplify**](../../design-process/design-mode/deformers/simplify.md) tool (especially recommended for models generated with **`Hunyuan 3`**).<br>
* Mesh can be edited in [**Edit Mode**](../../design-process/edit-mode/), including splitting a single mesh into multiple independent parts.<br>
* Generated textures can be edited, material properties adjusted, and new materials applied -[materials-and-textures](../../design-process/materials-and-textures/ "mention").<br>
* [**Decals**](../../design-process/decals.md) can be applied to the object to add labels, details, or graphic elements.<br>
* Lighting and additional rendering effects can be configured to achieve a more professional visual result - [light-sources.md](../../design-process/design-mode/light-sources.md "mention") , [environment.md](../../design-process/environment.md "mention"), [effects](../../design-process/effects/ "mention") .<br>
* Result can be previewed in [**AR**](../../project-settings/augmented-reality-webar.md).<br>
* [Public link ](../../sharing-exporting-embedding/sharing.md)to a 3D viewer with the scene can be generated.<br>
*   Project [UI](../../3d-configurator/floating-ui/) can be create&#x64;**,** including [hotspots](../../3d-configurator/hotspots.md) and annotations for presenting additional information or guiding interaction.

    <br>

And many-many other workflows and tools available in Vectary can be applied to the generated model.





#### Limitations



Certain plans include GenAI usage limits, defined as a specific number of generations per month. Each generation action reduces the available balance by one. When the limit is reached, GenAI features become unavailable until it resets at the beginning of the next month or is extended by upgrading to a higher plan or contacting the [Sales team](https://www.vectary.com/business-contact/) for a custom solution.

GenAI usage limits can be found in the Studio menu as well as in the Dashboard settings:
