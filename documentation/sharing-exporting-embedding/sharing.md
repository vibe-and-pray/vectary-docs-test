# Sharing



## Overview



In Vectary, a unique link can be generated for a 3D project, allowing it to be opened on any device, in any browser. Projects can also be embedded directly into websites or platforms that support iframe or URL embedding.

## Sharing a project



Projects are private by default and accessible only to you and your workspace members. To share your project:

1. Click the **Share** button in the top-right corner
2. If you’ve made changes, click **Update all changes** to sync the latest version
3. Copy the generated link or embed code

If any changes were made to the project, simply update them by clicking **Update all changes**:

Once shared, your project becomes accessible to anyone with the link or through the embedded view.&#x20;

**Share** can be disabled at any time to make the project inaccessible.

## Publish (legacy)&#x20;

The older **Publish** option is now deprecated, does not support current features, and uses a completely different rendering engine. To ensure full feature support and a consistent experience, the **Share** option should be used.
