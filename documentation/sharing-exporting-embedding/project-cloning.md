# Project cloning

The **Cloning** feature adds a button to a shared project, allowing other Vectary users to duplicate the project into their own workspace.&#x20;

This option is especially useful for templates, educational resources, or collaborative workflows where individual editable copies are needed.

The feature can be activated in the **Share settings** by enabling **Cloning**.

When enabled, a **Clone** button appears in the bottom-left corner of the viewer. Selecting it creates a complete copy of the project.
