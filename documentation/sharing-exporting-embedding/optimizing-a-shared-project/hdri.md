# HDRI

HDRI maps are a powerful way to light scenes and add realistic reflections. Every project in Vectary comes with a default [HDRI environment](../../design-process/environment.md) that provides basic lighting by default. You can choose from a range of HDRI maps available in the [built-in library](../../design-process/libraries/environments-library.md) via the Environment settings, or import a custom HDRI file. However, keep in mind that HDRI maps can dramatically increase project size — especially when imported in high resolution.



#### Tips & recommendations



* **Check file size before importing** – HDRI files, particularly custom ones, can be very large. Always verify the file size and consider optimizing before upload.<br>
* **Reduce resolution if possible** – HDRI resolution has a direct impact on its file size. If your scene doesn’t rely on fine background detail, consider using a lower resolution HDRI to reduce load times.\
  HDRI resolution can be adjusted directly in Studio — in the Environment settings.\

* **Use compression** – when exporting or preparing HDRI files, consider using **DWAA** or **DWAB** compression. These methods can significantly reduce file size without major visual loss.
