#### Saving



* By default, auto-save functionality is enabled in projects, meaning the project automatically saves every minute when changes are detected.
* If auto-save is disabled, projects can be manually saved using **Ctrl+S**.
* Additionally, the project is automatically saved when navigating back to the dashboard.



All saved versions can be restored through Version History.

To access Version History:<br>

1. Open the Menu and select "Version History"
2. On the right-hand panel, a list of all saved project versions will appear

\
Each version entry includes two icons:<br>

* <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (447).png" alt="" data-size="line"> allows downloading a version file
* <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (448).png" alt="" data-size="line"> enables restoring the version directly onto the canvas
