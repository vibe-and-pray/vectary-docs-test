# Mouse controls

This feature allows customization of mouse movement sensitivity and behavior for rotation, panning, and dolly (zoom) actions in a shared project. These settings apply globally to the entire project. However, specific limitations related to camera rotation, zoom, and panning can also be individually configured in each [camera's settings](../design-process/camera.md#view-limits).<br>

**`1`** — **Rotation sensitivity**: Adjusts the responsiveness of object rotation to mouse movements.

**`2`** — **Panning sensitivity**: Defines how responsive the project is when panning (horizontal and vertical movements).

**`3`** — **Dolly sensitivity**: Sets the zoom sensitivity level when using the mouse.

**`4`** — **Dolly to cursor**: When enabled, zooming centers around the cursor position. When disabled, zooming centers around the viewport center.

**`5`** — **Mouse follow**: Activates automatic camera following based on cursor movements.

**`6`** — **Sensitivity** (Mouse follow): Determines the responsiveness of camera following to cursor movements.

**`7`** — **Resume after**: Sets the duration (in seconds) before the camera resumes automatic following after user interaction stops.

**`8`** — **Invert axes**: When enabled, the axes of mouse control are inverted.
