# System requirements



Projects created in Vectary run seamlessly across all devices and operating systems through [WebGL 2.0](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/) in the browser.



Minimum Hardware Requirements for Vectary Studio:

* 2.0 GHz multi-core processor
* 8 GB of RAM or higher
* Graphics card with at least 1 GB of dedicated or shared video memory

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that on low-performance devices, scene quality may be automatically reduced to maintain optimal performance.
{% endhint %}

\
We highly recommend using the **Google Chrome** browser for the best possible experience, due to the limitations on key technologies used by Vectary in other browsers.<br>

{% hint style="info" %}
On desktop and laptop computers equipped with multiple graphics cards, ensure that Vectary Studio is running in the browser using the dedicated, high-performance graphics card for optimal results.
{% endhint %}



Vectary Studio is not optimized or intended for use on **mobile devices**. However, certain actions can still be performed from mobile devices if the browser is set to desktop mode. Please note that the experience will be significantly limited. It is recommended to use a computer for the best results.
