# Dashboard



## Overview



The dashboard serves as the initial interface presented upon signing up as a new user or logging in. It functions as a central hub for managing all projects and workspaces.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (501).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="success" %}
The dashboard is optimized for mobile devices
{% endhint %}



## Workspaces

\
The squares on the left side of the dashboard represent workspaces:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (502).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Workspaces** are independent entities, each with its own subscription and role settings. When a subscription is purchased, it applies exclusively to that specific workspace. Therefore, to operate multiple workspaces, a separate subscription must be acquired for each individual workspace.

### Workspace settings <a href="#block-d6616fe400eb478ab64bb415a1f195f9" id="block-d6616fe400eb478ab64bb415a1f195f9"></a>

\
To open workspace settings, select **`Settings`** from the list. \
Direct link to workspace settings: [https://www.vectary.com/dashboard/?workspace\_settings=true\&tab=Settings](https://www.vectary.com/dashboard/?workspace_settings=true\&tab=Settings)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (507).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Workspace settings offer the following options:<br>

* Manage workspace members
* View the three most recent invoices
* Upload a cover image for a workspace
* Rename a workspace
* Leave a workspace
* Delete a workspace



### Members <a href="#block-0a23bb7ea7504d10a056b7a4d3cd266c" id="block-0a23bb7ea7504d10a056b7a4d3cd266c"></a>

\
\
To manage workspace members, select **`Team Members`** from the list ([https://www.vectary.com/dashboard/?workspace\_settings=true\&tab=Members](https://www.vectary.com/dashboard/?workspace_settings=true\&tab=Members))<br>

{% hint style="warning" %}
Access to these settings is available only to the workspace **Owner** and **Manager**.
{% endhint %}

The Team Members management section allows sending new email invitations and assigning participant roles.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (505).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To invite a new member, enter their email address into the designated field, assign their [role](roles.md) (which can be changed at any time), and click the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (312).png" alt="" data-size="line"> button. The invited user will receive an email containing an invitation with a button to accept it.

If a person invited to a workspace does not have a Vectary account, they will receive an email invitation with a link to register with Vectary. After registration, the workspace will be automatically added to their dashboard.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (508).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
If an invited user already has a Vectary account, it is not necessary to check the email inbox to accept the invitation. Simply refreshing the dashboard page will automatically accept the invitation.
{% endhint %}



Once a member joins a workspace, they can use both their primary workspace and the ones they have joined.



### Billing <a href="#block-2aeae337a8b34714ab6f8294fee211af" id="block-2aeae337a8b34714ab6f8294fee211af"></a>

{% hint style="danger" %}
Access to the billing section of the workspace is available only to the workspace owner
{% endhint %}

The workspace settings include a **Billing tab** (Direct link to Billing: [**https://www.vectary.com/dashboard/?workspace\_settings=true\&tab=Billing**](https://www.vectary.com/dashboard/?workspace_settings=true\&tab=Billing)), providing access to information and actions related to the subscription:

<i class="fa-1">:1:</i> - details of the current subscription plan, including renewal date

<i class="fa-2">:2:</i> - option to cancel the subscription

<i class="fa-3">:3:</i> - three most recent invoices

<div align="left"><figure><img src="https://images.spr.so/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/j42No7y-dcokJuNgXeA0ig/f5c51717-d587-4c03-bc01-ef62ec58b0b3/image/w=3840,quality=90,fit=scale-down" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

{% hint style="warning" %}
Invoices are sent via Paddle, Vectary’s payment provider. For help or assistance with your receipt or tax information, please reply to your last invoice or contact [help@paddle.com](mailto:help@paddle.com)
{% endhint %}



### Workspace tips



{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Order of workspaces" %}
\
The order of workspaces can be changed as needed. \
Simply drag the workspace cover to the desired position.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Workspace ID" %}
\
The workspace ID can be copied from the URL (in case of support requests).

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (486).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}





## Folders <a href="#block-5cdbf14b1f1145108590de6c16439285" id="block-5cdbf14b1f1145108590de6c16439285"></a>



Each workspace includes the ability to create folders, which assists in organizing project storage. Projects can be easily moved from one folder to another through a simple drag-and-drop action.

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

#### Archived

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (316).png" alt="" data-size="line"> — this folder stores deleted projects, which still count towards the workspace's project limit. A project in this folder can either be **restored** or permanently **deleted**.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (511).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



## Projects <a href="#block-c84c946af1534140974a809559f1a576" id="block-c84c946af1534140974a809559f1a576"></a>





* Projects can be created in any folder and freely moved both between folders and workspaces.
* Project sorting cannot be changed; they are automatically sorted by the date of their last edit.
* Project limit depends on the selected plan.
* Deleted projects are moved to the **Archived** folder and can be restored at any time. Projects in the **Archived** folder also count toward the limit, so if a project is no longer needed, it should be permanently deleted from this folder.





### Preview mode



In the Dashboard, a project can be opened in preview mode. This mode simplifies project viewing and provides access to basic settings without fully loading the project.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
A project can be opened in preview mode **only if it has been&#x20;**<mark style="color:green;">**shared**</mark>**.**&#x20;

The preview displays a **shared version** of the project.
{% endhint %}

{% embed url="https://screen.studio/share/Ho5E58Fs" %}



* If a project **is&#x20;**<mark style="color:red;">**not shared**</mark>, double-clicking a project opens it in **Studio**.&#x20;
* If a project **is&#x20;**<mark style="color:green;">**shared**</mark> (indicated by a [green dot](dashboard.md#green-dot) in the top-left corner of the thumbnail), double-clicking opens the project in **Preview mode**. <br>
* A project can be opened straight in Studio (bypassing the Preview mode) by using the icon in the upper-right corner:\
  \
  ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (29).png>)<br>
* To open a project in Studio from the Preview mode, click the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (51).png" alt="" data-size="line"> button.



Currently, Preview mode allows the following actions:<br>

* Copy a project link
* Change privacy settings
* Enable or disable Augmented Reality for the project
* Rename a project
* Open a project preview in a new tab
* Open a project in Studio (desktop and tablet only)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (510).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>





### Project description and tags <a href="#block-d37dbeb9403247f3b29d526a315ac422" id="block-d37dbeb9403247f3b29d526a315ac422"></a>



For projects to be discoverable via search, they must have a description or tags.

To add or edit these details, click the project name or select **Project details** from the context menu to open the project card.

{% hint style="success" %}
Project search is available both in the [Dashboard and in Studio](dashboard.md#project-search).
{% endhint %}

{% embed url="https://screen.studio/share/Pu0qpfdC" %}



{% hint style="success" %}
When tagging projects, use labels such as 'finished' or 'public' to improve the efficiency of locating desired projects in search results, especially when dealing with duplicates or versions with similar titles.
{% endhint %}



### Project cover



A project cover can be replaced with a custom image. To do this, open the project details and select **Upload Cover**.



<div align="left"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (512).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>





### Project tips<br>

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Green dot" %}


The **green dot** in the top left corner indicates that the project is [shared](https://help.vectary.com/sharing). Clicking it will copy the project link to the clipboard.

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (319).png" alt="" width="462"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Project movement" %}


Projects can be moved to other workspaces or folders by dragging and dropping them onto the cover of the desired workspace or the name of the folder.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Project Selection" %}


Multiple projects can be selected, and all actions will apply to the selected projects. It is also possible to simultaneously move multiple projects to another workspace or folder.

To select all projects in a workspace, use Ctrl + A.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (489).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}





### Importing a project into another project (Design system) <a href="#block-4edc4b5bfd2e4e0191a4f41b9396d303" id="block-4edc4b5bfd2e4e0191a4f41b9396d303"></a>



Any existing projects can be imported directly into the current project within the Studio. \
To do this in Studio, open the **Workspace** tab on the left panel, select the desired workspace, and view all projects and folders within it. A project can be placed in a specific position by dragging it onto the canvas.

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (321).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Learn more about how it works:

### Projects marked with M



If a project card is marked with M, it indicates that the project contains a custom material saved by either the user or another workspace member.

Learn more about how it works:

## Upload 3D file



The **Upload 3D file** mode allows importing a 3D file directly from the dashboard without opening Studio.

After the file is uploaded, a new project is automatically created in the workspace. The project can then either be shared via a link or opened in Studio for further editing.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (490).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Supported formats** in this mode: `FBX`, `GLB`, `GLTF`, `OBJ`, `STL`, `DAE`, `ZIP`\
To import other file formats, open a project in Studio.\
For a full list of supported formats, see [this page](../importing/).

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** projects created via this import method include preconfigured lighting and additional [rendering effects](../design-process/effects/). When continuing to work on the project in Studio, verify that these settings align with the intended appearance of the scene.
{% endhint %}





## Project search



Project search is based on the project name, [description, and tags](dashboard.md#block-d37dbeb9403247f3b29d526a315ac422).



Search is available in both the Dashboard and Studio.
